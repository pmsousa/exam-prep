For the az-500 exam, you won't need to write any code yourself, however, you are expected to be proficient in scripting and automation.
This means you may be expected to recognise the correct powershell commands and parameters and so these files do not include the powershell commands to recreate the demos fully
but will give you some familiarity with the relevant powershell commands for this section of the exam.
Comments and explicit variable names are used to explain what is happening in each step.

These files contain all the core commands for the exam but do not cover every use case or variation.
Therefore, reading through the Microsoft documentation may also be beneficial to see less common parameters or use cases.
